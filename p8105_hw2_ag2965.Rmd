  mutate(entry = if_else("yes", "no",TRUE,FALSE))
```

The subway dataset contains the following columns: the subway line, the names of the stations the line operates at, station latitude and longitude, the 11 routes served, the presence or absence of an entry and entrance type, the presence or absence of vending,  and whether the station is ADA compliant.
